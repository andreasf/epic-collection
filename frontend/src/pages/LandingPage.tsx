                        Epic Collection helps you reclaim space in your Spotify library when you have reached the limit
                        of 10000 tracks.
                    </p>
                    <p>It frees up space by moving albums, not deleting them. That means you can keep all your music.</p>

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Spotify accounts consist of a library of saved tracks and albums, <i>and</i> a set of playlists. That's right,
                        playlists are not part of the library. In fact, <i>each</i> playlist has the same maximum size as the entire
                        library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Epic Collection makes use of this by moving whole albums from the library to a new playlist. By moving an
                        album with 10 tracks, it frees up 11 spots in the library: one for each track and an extra item for the album
                        itself.

                            Yes, it's safe and no, I am not stealing your password. The app never even receives
                            your password. It uses the Spotify Web API and redirects you to Spotify itself for logging
                            in.

                    Epic Collection is a pure frontend web application that exclusively talks to the Spotify Web API for the purpose of
                    freeing up space in the library. The web server serving this frontend collects technical HTTP access logs for
                    operational purposes, which could be stored for a limited amount of time. The app itself does not collect any data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, Spotify collects behavioral data (so that they can give recommendations) and makes some aggregate
                    statistics available to app developers through the Spotify Developer Dashboard, e.g.:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Daily and monthly active users</li>
                    <li>Number of requests per endpoint</li>
                    <li>Number of users per country</li>
                    <li>Total number of requests per day</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        );
